## A template for creating libraries for react with typescript:
It is setup with rollup and have support for typescript, react testing library, pre commit hooks, linters.

## Why
I wanted a quick way to start buillding a library so i created this template where you just clone it or whatever and start building your components.


## Usage
`git clone`

`yarn`

`yarn build`
